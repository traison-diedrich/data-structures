Running the program:
    The program can be run by opening main.py in IDLE and running the module or...
    You can navigate to the Project1 directory and run (python main.py) in the terminal

Notes:
    This folder contains the classes Tree.py, BST.py, and RBT.py. All 3 are used in main.py
        which handles the UI for testing the tree and input types.

    Building a Binary Search Tree with any sorted input will crash the program due to python's 
        recursion limits. A construction time can be found for both sorted15K and sorted30K, 
        however I would advise against attempting any larger inputs

Thanks! Traison
